# Blade for WordPress

WP Blade brings the beloved Blade template engine to your WordPress-theme.

Blade is a much simpler template language than vanilla PHP, and compiles down to readable PHP.

The plugin is intended for WordPress theme-developers that want to write a different flavor of template languages.

Read more about Blade in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/blade).
